# Gateway2Jordan_KingHusseinBridge
This is a web-page scraping project. It automatically checks if the King Hussein Bridge opened to welcome Palestinian passengers to pass through. Since Palestinians struggle in their travel specially in this specific point, I made this script to help them instead of manually checking the website every moment.

It is scraping the webpage in the link:
```bash
https://www.gateway2jordan.gov.jo/landplatform/
```
 And it detects if the bridge has been added to the platform.



## Usage

You run the program using python, and it take the argument an **int** number which determines the number of minutes each time to check the website. For example, if the user enters **_20_**, this means the script will check the website every **_20_** minutes.

Once the bridge is added to the form, the program will automatically start an alarm sound. Which keeps beeping until the user ends (shutdown) the program.
